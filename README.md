# A structured introduction to system design

My goal with this repository is to create an archive of my systems design knowledge and document my journey tackling the subject, so that others can have a less intimidating introduction to the subject, than, say, 
[system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).

See [resources.md](resources.md) for an annotated bibliography of system design resources.


## Exercises


## Ramblings
- To get good at system design, you have to both read and implement real software systems. 
- It's harder to fake than programming ability (read: leetcode) because it requires a large amount of knowledge which is abstract without the ability to apply it
- It's hard to gain actual systems design experience because you have to build a real, nontrivial software system, and it has to get big enough that performance and scalability become actual issues.
- The proxy for building real systems is making notes / teaching, and then testing your knowledge in mock interviews.
- Though if you have time and idea to design a highly scalable system, I suggest you go do it.
