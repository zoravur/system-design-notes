Logging Cost

Q1: How much will the storage of logs cost for a standard, monolithic 100k RPS web application?

Some assumptions:
- Store logs for 5 years


Estimation:
- Need to estimate log generation in terms of storage / second, to get the total cost per month.
- We can then mulitply this by 5 years to get the total logs generated in a 5 year window. We may 
go slightly under or over this cost, especially as the requests per second of the application 
varies. 
- Okay, we have log generation as 100k requests / second * average number of GBs per request
- Let's say that that each log line averages to 128 characters. If it were more, it would 
be difficult to fit on a screen. 
- Therefore, we're looking at 128 bytes * 100k requests / second = 12,800,000 = 12.8 MB per second.
- 13 MB per second * 5 years -- how many seconds in a year? Roughly 31,536,000, ignoring leap years.
5 years is roughly 150 million seconds then. So 13MB/s * 150 million seconds = 13 * 150 = 1500 + 450 = 1950 million MB = 1950 TB. Since we rounded down seconds earlier, we can scale it back up to 2 PB.
That's a lot of storage. So we would need to do something to reduce the amount of logs.

If we're estimating cost, we're looking at infrequent access, so one cent per gigabyte per month.
So maybe 0.01 / GB, so $20k a month. Wow, less than I thought. 

Actual solution:

Closer to 1k - 10k a month. Fair. I guess, who's storing storage for 5 years. Should examine 
my assumptions a bit.
